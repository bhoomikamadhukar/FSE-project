This is the backend (node) repository of our project. There are various feature branches and the main branch has everything merged into it. The link to the backend (node) repository is - https://github.com/bhoomikamadhukar/FSE-project.

Overview of the Proposed Feature

We are creating admin tools for managing users including creation, updation, deletion and viewing of the user accounts. The proposed feature allows the administration to manage users in this tuiter application. The administrator can create, update, delete and retrieve user accounts. This feature will allow admin to create an account on behalf of the user. This will also provide access to the admin to control and manage user accounts that are inactive for a prolonged time by deleting them. The administrator can also control the access level of user accounts.  
We are interested in building this feature as this will provide the admin with a UI which allows the admin to retrieve, manage and control user accounts without having to bother with the technical details of the application. This tool has a lot more use cases such as flagging of users, access level control, etc. Being able to create user accounts will also help the development phase of this application to create users and test out the features.
